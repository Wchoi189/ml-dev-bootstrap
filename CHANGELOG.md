## [0.3.0] - 2025-09-08

### Added

  - Multiple access points: `~/setup` (user symlink), `/root/ml-dev-bootstrap` (compatibility symlink)
  - Smart permission delegation with setgid bit for consistent group ownership
  - Seamless user switching with `--switch-user` option and menu integration

- **Flexible Root Requirements**:
  - Smart detection of when root privileges are required vs optional
  - `ALLOW_NON_ROOT=true` support for user-specific operations
  - Clear messaging about permission requirements

- **User Switching Features**:
  - `--switch-user` command-line option with clear guidance

### Changed

- **File Location Strategy**:

  - Created symlinks for backward compatibility and user convenience
  - Improved permission model with dev group ownership

- **User Module Enhancements**:
  - `configure_setup_directory_permissions()` now handles `/opt` location optimally
  - Automatic symlink creation for user access points
  - Enhanced permission configuration with setgid support

- **Common Utilities**:
  - `check_requirements()` now intelligently determines root requirements
  - Better support for user-specific operations without root

### Fixed

- **Permission Issues**:
  - Resolved `/root` directory traversal issues for development users
  - Fixed log file permission conflicts between root and user contexts
  - Eliminated permission denied errors when switching users

- **User Switching Problems**:
  - Manual `su dev-user` now works correctly with proper path access
  - Environment manager installations work in user context
  - No more permission conflicts between root and user operations

### Security

- **Permission Hardening**:
  - Proper group-based access control with setgid directories
  - Secure multi-user file permissions (775 for dirs, 664 for files)
  - Maintained root ownership while allowing dev group access

## [0.2.1] - 2025-08-24

### Added

- Environment Manager (envmgr):
    - System-wide Poetry install to `/opt/pypoetry` with dev-group permissions and global shim at `/usr/local/bin/poetry`.
    - Fallback Poetry installation using a dedicated venv when the official installer fails.
    - Global PATH profile `/etc/profile.d/ml-dev-tools.sh` to ensure `/usr/local/bin`, `/opt/pypoetry/bin`, and `$HOME/.local/bin` are available across shells.

### Changed

- Hardened config sourcing across modules using BASH_SOURCE to resolve `config/defaults.conf` reliably.
- Pyenv and Pipenv modules now enforce dev-group permissions and create global shims when running as root.

### Fixed

- Resolved permission holes causing installs to be root-only and inaccessible to other users.
- Fixed path bugs where modules sourced `../config/defaults.conf` incorrectly when executed from different locations.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-07-30

### Added

- **Maintenance & Troubleshooting Tools**:
    - Implemented a `--diagnose` flag to run comprehensive checks on the environment.
    - Added an `--update` flag to update system packages and conda environments.
    - Added a `--backup` flag to create a backup of important configuration files.
- **Profile-based Installation**:
    - Introduced a `GLOBAL_INSTALL_PROFILE` setting in `config/defaults.conf` to choose between `minimal`, `standard`, and `full` setups.
- **User Experience**:
    - Added a `--progress` flag to display a progress bar during a full (`--all`) installation.

### Changed

- **Environment Management**:
    - Replaced the Conda installation with **Micromamba** for significantly faster and more reliable environment creation.
    - The `conda` module now creates a dedicated named environment instead of installing packages into the `base` environment.
- **Efficiency**:
    - Optimized the permission-setting logic for conda environments to avoid long delays on systems with slow disk I/O.
- **Robustness**:
    - Hardened the `locale` and `user` modules to prevent common configuration issues and to provide better diagnostics.
